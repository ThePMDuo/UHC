/**
 * Class AimAssistB
 * @package ethaniccc\Mockingbird\detections\combat\aimassist
 * AimAssistB exploits a flaw in some aim-assists where the yawDelta / pitchDelta is rounded.
 * While testing Ascendency's aim-assist, this kind of behaviour occured (see https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/727159224320131133/795739419998289960/unknown.png?width=469&height=523).
 * In the screenshot mentioned above, the yaw and pitch delta seem to be rounded to some extent, and this is where this check comes in.
