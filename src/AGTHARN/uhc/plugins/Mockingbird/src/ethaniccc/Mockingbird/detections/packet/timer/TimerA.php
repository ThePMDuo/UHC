/**
 * Class TimerA
 * @package ethaniccc\Mockingbird\detections\packet\timer
 * TimerA checks if a player is sending movement packets too fast while accounting for lag (this will no longer false on server lag).
 * The way TimerA accounts for lag is by using a concept of "balance". These movement packets should be sending 1 tick every time, so
 * every time we receive a movement packet, we get the time difference in ticks, and add that to the balance. From there, we subtract by
 * one, as one is the expected time it should be taking. If the balance goes below a threshold (-5), flag.
